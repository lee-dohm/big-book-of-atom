# The Big Book of Atom

[Atom][atom] is an open-source, cross-platform text editor designed for use by programmers and built by [GitHub][github]. It is meant to be "a hackable editor for the 21st century". It borrows a lot from many of the other popular text editors that have come before it: TextMate, Sublime Text, even vi and emacs. But it does so in an unique way by building on top of Web technologies, by making things as modular as possible and, of course, keeping everything open-source.

This book seeks to become the definitive reference guide for the Atom editor.
