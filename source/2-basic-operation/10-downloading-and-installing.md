# Downloading and Installing

The simplest way is to go to the [Atom website][atom.io] and click the big green button to download the appropriate version for your system. If that doesn't work, one can always go to the [releases page][releases] to pick the appropriate version. The releases page is always more up-to-date than the Atom website, but you'll need to know which Atom package to pick.

Once the appropriate package has been downloaded, then simply install like any other application from the Internet.
