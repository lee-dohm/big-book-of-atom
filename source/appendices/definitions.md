## Casing

In some instances, we will refer to various types of common case notations for naming. These are the terms we are using and what they mean:

* `camelCase` &mdash; Each word after the first capitalized with no separation
* `PascalCase` &mdash; Each word capitalized with no separation
* `SCREAMING_CAPS` &mdash; All caps with underscores (`_`) separating words
* `snake_case` &mdash; All lower-case with underscores (`_`) separating words
* `strike-case` &mdash; All lower-case with hyphens (`-`) separating words
