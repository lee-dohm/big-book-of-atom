Here are a couple more examples of markdown elements. Here we have a blockquote:

> Don't think about making art, just get it done. Let everyone else decide if it's good or bad, whether they love it or hate it. While they are deciding, make even more art.
> Andy Warhol

And a numbered list:

1. Numbered Item 1
2. Numbered Item 2
3. Numbered Item 3

And a code block (with syntax highlighting).

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

And a horizontal rule.
