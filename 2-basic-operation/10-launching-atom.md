# Launching Atom

When launching Atom, there are a couple things to keep in mind. The first is that Atom is built around the concept of "projects". The idea of a project should be familiar to any software developer, it is a collection of files, directories and configuration that are related by virtue of the fact that they all contribute to the same system. Atom's definition of a project is based upon a single Git repository. When you launch Atom from the root directory of a Git repository, it assumes that you want to work on the project that the Git repository represents.
